                    +"While the concept is not necessarily new in literature, the show has a disturbing take on justifying Joeâ€™s motives for stalking and killing in order to manufacture an ideal romance. In the process, You deconstructs the typical behavior of male heroes by removing the rose-colored lens of romantic stories and presenting a realistic, albeit troubling, view of the boy-meets-girl storyline.",
